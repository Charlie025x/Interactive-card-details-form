## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/) - CSS framework
- [React Hook Form](https://react-hook-form.com/) - React framework

### What I learned

Building this form page reminded me how challenging working with forms can be. This time around I discovered the React-Hook-Form package. This npm package abstracts the form building process by doing some React boilerplate code for me. This is also the first time I used Tailwind in a project, aside from the constant referencing to the Tailwind documentation, it was pretty easy to use Tailwind.

### Useful resources

- [React Hook Form Tutorials | Codevolution](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLC3y8-rFHvwjmgBr1327BA5bVXoQH-w5s&si=CKVyDrt2K5rPt3_D) - This YouTube playlist contains video tutorials on React-Hook-Form. React Hook Form is a npm package that makes working with Forms a little easier on a React envirnment. This playlist is great for teaching the ins and outs of the package, it especialy helped me with form error and state handleing.
- [tailwindcss.com](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation) - Tailwindcss is a utility-first CSS framework packed with classes like flex, pt-4, text-center and rotate-90 that can be composed to build any design, directly in your markup. This is my first time using TailwindCss and I got to say. It sure is different from writing regular css. I like how the documentation is organized and how I need to type less code to get websites to look good, the trade off is that the html gets loaded with classes. Overall Tailwind is great and I see myself using it in future projects.
- [Sorting Tailwind CSS Classes Automatically with Prettier](https://youtu.be/_CntOc4hBcg?si=1GDnZ8K-sBQ5hyFo) - Html classes get chaotic when using tailwind, but Prettier makes class names more organized. This video was great for helping me set up Prettier.
- [Add spaces in react-hook-forms while typing](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/65013568/add-spaces-in-react-hook-forms-while-typing) - This stack overflow post was a life saver for getting the credit card number properly formated with spaces every 4 characters.
